# ISKOLARO

ISKOLARO is a classic memory game derived from the electronic Simon Game, that challenges players to remember and reproduce increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds. It provides a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages, testing their memory skills and ability to focus under pressure.

How to Play/Use:

1. The game starts with a simple sequence of colors and sounds.
2. Watch and listen carefully to the sequence played by the game.
3. Reproduce the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons in the correct order.
4. If you reproduce the sequence correctly, the game will play a longer sequence in the next round.
5. Continue to repeat the sequences correctly to advance through the levels and achieve a high score.
6. If you make a mistake and press the wrong button or miss a button press, the game will end the current round.
7. To play again, simply start a new game by turning on the Simon game device and repeating the steps above.
